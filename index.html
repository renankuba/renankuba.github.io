                    <dt>Photography</dt>
                    <dd>Taking time to observe things and places, trying to capture a stunning composition as well as extract a story from that is something that captivates me.
                        During one click and another, I find my peace, and also I can improve my creativity.</dd>
                    <dt>Street Run</dt>
                    <dd>To exercise my body, I try to run 2-3 times a week. 
                        It's always a challenge to keep myself motivated to complete another kilometer.
                        Although I don't run long distances, who knows maybe I'll run a marathon one day.</dd>
                    <dt>Video Games</dt>
                    <dd>In my spare time, I like playing some good video games. With that, I can either enjoy an excellent story and mechanics or just spend some pleasant time with friends playing together.</dd>
